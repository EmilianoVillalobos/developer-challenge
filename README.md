# PennyMac Developer Challenge

This directory contains my solution for the PennyMac developer challenge. I was given data files and prompted to
extract and output information using the given data. The prompts can be found below.

The output can be found in `output.txt`. In my output file, I elected to include progress messages in the output file
to outline my process. I also included the final dataframe that was used to determine my answer for reference.

## Prompts
### Weather

In the attached file (w_data.dat), you’ll find daily weather data. Download this text file, then write a program to 
output the day number (column one) with the smallest temperature spread (the maximum temperature is the second column, 
the minimum the third column).

### Soccer
The attached soccer.dat file contains the results from the English Premier League. The columns labeled ‘F’ and ‘A’ 
contain the total number of goals scored for and against each team in that season (so Arsenal scored 79 goals against 
opponents, and had 36 goals scored against them). Write a program to print the name of the team with the smallest 
difference in ‘for’ and ‘against’ goals.
